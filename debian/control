Description: Real-time VM monitoring for KVM and Proxmox VE - esxtop for Linux
 proxtop is a real-time VM monitoring tool for KVM and Proxmox VE hypervisors.
 Think of it as esxtop for Linux virtualization.
 .
 proxtop reads resource utilization metrics from the hypervisor level (not
 inside the guest), giving you visibility into what VMs actually consume
 including virtualization overhead. This is essential for troubleshooting
 performance issues and detecting noisy neighbor problems.
 .
 Features:
  - CPU: steal time, ready time, per-vCPU utilization
  - Memory: RSS, balloon, page faults, swap activity
  - Disk: IOPS, throughput, latency (read/write/flush), queue depth
  - Network: bytes/packets, per-device breakdown
  - Interactive ncurses UI with field selector and multiple view modes
  - Verbose mode toggle for additional detailed metrics
  - Human-readable units (KB/MB/GB) toggle
  - Text and JSON output for scripting
  - TCP streaming to InfluxDB, Prometheus, Logstash
  - Auto-detection of KVM and Proxmox VE environments
 .
 This package contains the proxtop monitoring tool and proxprofiler
 statistical profiling tool.
